#### TutorAI: Unlocking Your Potential

TutorAI is an innovative educational platform powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 and Langchain technologies. It offers three core features - "Learn," "Talk," and "Test" - to enhance the learning experience. Built using the Streamlit framework, TutorAI aims to revolutionize how learners interact with and consume educational content.

#### Interactive Learning

Our platform offers an interactive learning experience like no other. You have the freedom to choose from a variety of real-life situations and scenarios in which you'd like to improve your skills.

### Key Features

##### Learn:

In the "Learn" module, users can input questions or topics they want to learn about. TutorAI leverages GPT-3's natural language processing capabilities to generate informative, human-like responses. Whether it's explanations, historical context, scientific concepts, or language translation, TutorAI acts as a personalized tutor, providing detailed, context-aware explanations.

#### Talk:

The "Talk" feature transforms TutorAI into an interactive conversation partner. Users can engage in natural conversations with the AI, seeking answers to their queries, discussing ideas, or simply engaging in stimulating dialogue. Whether it's brushing up on a foreign language or having a deep discussion about a favorite book, TutorAI is ready to chat.

#### Test:

The "Test" function is a powerful tool for assessment. Users can create custom quizzes and tests on any subject, and TutorAI will generate questions with multiple-choice answers. After taking the test, users receive immediate feedback and explanations for the correct answers. This feature is ideal for both self-assessment and practicing for exams or certifications.
